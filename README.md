This is a program from my thesis that I made using Python programming language with the Sagemath library.
If you want to use this code, you can run using Sagemath notebook or Cocalc.
This code can't direct run on python without Sagemath.
The decryption can take long time with large file because the decryption using library from Sagemath.
